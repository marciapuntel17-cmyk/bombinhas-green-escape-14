# WordPress Theme Images

This folder should contain the following images for the theme to work properly:

1. **hero-pousada.jpg** - Hero section background image
2. **acomodacoes.jpg** - Accommodations section image  
3. **cafe-da-manha.jpg** - Breakfast experience image
4. **praia-bombinhas.jpg** - Beach attractions image

These images should be optimized for web use and follow these guidelines:
- Hero image: minimum 1920x1080px for full coverage
- Section images: recommended 800x600px or similar aspect ratio
- File format: JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
- Optimize for web to reduce file size while maintaining quality

To add images:
1. Upload your images to this /images/ folder
2. Name them according to the list above
3. Update the WordPress Customizer to reference your custom images if needed

The theme will fall back to default placeholder content if images are not found.
